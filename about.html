                    <h1> About me </h1>
                <p>I completed my Diploma degree in Computer Science stream from Suntech computer institute in 2017 . While earning my degree, I completed a 3 month Intensive Graphics Training at Copy Centre. </p>
                <p>After graduating I joined Blessed Goodness as a Graphics Designer. Recently, I completed a full-time web development intensive course from The New York Code + Design Academy online. Currently, I'm working on getting my ML and AI certificate from same academy online and spending my time advancing my skills in web-development and programming in general.
                    As a developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between functionality and design. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences. In addition, I am highly responsive to client needs and also committed to helping people realize their vision.</p>
